      "message": "I think we want to describe this more like this:\n\nThe `softMaxStartForQueuePerUser` setting defines a soft maximum number of threads per user that should be started for a specific task and queue combination. Unlike the `maxStartPerUserForTaskForQueue`, a softMax will allow a user to start more tasks if the server has more than one idle thread. This helps maintain a high level of interactive responsiveness without dedicating too many threads which would likely stay idle when using a small `maxStartPerUserForTaskForQueue` setting. This setting helps to maintain a good balance between bulk throughput and low latency for interactive operations. This setting is recommended to help protect the server against users (and automation systems) which may be running the `repo` tool with high sync (-j) counts.\n\nAnd since I am comparing it to `maxStartPerUserForTaskForQueue`, maybe it should be named `softMaxStartPerUserForTaskForQueue`?",
