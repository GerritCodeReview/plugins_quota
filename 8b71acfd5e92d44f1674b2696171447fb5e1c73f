      "message": "I believe it does, the problem is different though.\n\nYou have two groups for two types and you receive the mapping of the limits associated with the two groups:\n- type \u003d\u003e group1 with limit1 for group1\n- type \u003d\u003e group2 with limit2 for group2\n\nIf the limit1 is _unlimited_ then you have a `null` value, which means that you need to look for the second group2 matching with a limit.\n\nI believe this method instead was getting the first matching group regardless that it had a limit or not, therefore was never matching the 2nd group.",
