      "message": "I believe it does, the problem is different though.\n\nYou have two groups for two types and you receive the mapping of the limits associated with the two groups:\n- type \u003d\u003e group1 with limit1 for group1\n- type \u003d\u003e group2 with limit2 for group2\n\nIf the limit1 is _unlimited_ then you have a `null` value, which means that you need to look for the second group2 matching with a limit.\n\nI believe this method instead was getting the first matching group regardless that it had a limit or not, therefore was never matching the 2nd group.",

      "message": "Yep that makes sense, I just noticed that the `limits \u003d getRatelimits(type);` returns *both* groups as keys\n\n```\ngroupLimitedOnUploadPack -\u003e {AccountLimitsConfig$RateLimit@12868}\ngroupLimitedOnRestApi -\u003e null\n```\n\nSince the `type` we filter by is `uploadpack`, I was expecting that it only returned the groups -\u003e filter tuple matching the `uploadpack` in configuration, not the `ratelimit` ones as well.\n\nIf this filter was done upfront, the check we do at L67 would be not necessary.\n\nHaving said that, this approach would be more invasive and I would not be confident in changing that at this stage.\n\nLet\u0027s go with your fix (which does the right thing), we can thinkg about consolidating as a separate/follow up step, if necessary.",
