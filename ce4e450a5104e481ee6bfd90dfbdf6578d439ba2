Maybe finding that commit in guava repository would provide additional\nexplanation for that decision? Especially I would like to refer\nto the DoNotMock annotation docs [1] where it is written:\n\n\"When marking a type @DoNotMock, you should always point to alternative testing solutions such as standard fakes or other testing utilities.\"\n\n[1] https://errorprone.info/api/latest/com/google/errorprone/annotations/DoNotMock.html",
